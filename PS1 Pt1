# Problem Set 1 - Kyle Bailey, Danielle Bauer

# Import packages
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

from scipy.stats import pearsonr
 
os.chdir('/Users/Kyle/Desktop/Python/Data')

# Question 1

# Read BWGHT data
df1 = pd.read_csv('/Users/Kyle/Desktop/Python/Data/BWGHT.csv')
df1.head()

# Question 1(i)
# The most likely sign for B2 is positive if birth weights are correlated with better prenatal care, 
# then having higher family income allows access to these resources leading to higher birth weights in turn

# Question 1(ii)
# cigs and faminc are likely to be loosely negatively correlated. Higher family income allows better medical 
# care and education that bring awareness to the dangers of cigarette smoking. This is confirmed by a Pearson 
# correlation coefficient of -0.17.
pearsonr(df1['cigs'],df1['faminc']) 

# Question 1(iii)
m1_1 = ols('bwght ~ cigs + faminc', data=df1).fit() 
m1_1.summary()
# bwght = 116.9741 -0.4634cigs + 0.0928faminc, n = 1388, r2 = 0.03
# Regression without family income
m1_2 = ols('bwght ~ cigs', data=df1).fit() 
m1_2.summary()
# bwght = 119.7719 -0.5138cigs, n = 1388, r2 = 0.023
# The regression results are certainly different, although not to a very high degree. The coefficient
# on cigs only changes from -0.46 to -0.51 (a one oz increase in birth is associated with ~.5 less cigarettes per day)
# Additionally, the fit of the model decreased only by 0.01 but with an r2 of less than .1 the explanatory power
# of the models are quite weak

# Question 3

# Read CEOSAL2 data
df3 = pd.read_csv('/Users/Kyle/Desktop/Python/Data/CEOSAL2.csv')
df3.head()

# Question 3(i)
m3_1 = ols('lsalary ~ lsales + lmktval', data=df3).fit()
m3_1.summary()
# lsalary = 4.6209 + 0.1621lsales + 0.1067lmktval

# Question 3(ii)
m3_2 = ols('lsalary ~ lsales + lmktval + profits', data=df3).fit()
m3_2.summary()
# We cannot include profits in this model due to them being measured in millions, with the rest of the equation in log
# form, the coefficient is extraordinarily small and statistically insignificant as well. Additionally, several firms
# in the dataset had negative profits (losses) such that trying to calculate lsalary will lead to it being undefined
# Given the r2 is roughly 0.30, I would say that this model does not capture most of the variation in CEO salaries 
# as we can only explain 30% of salary variation, including more variables would help us more clearly see the effects.

# Question 3(iii)
m3_3 = ols('lsalary ~ lsales + lmktval + profits + ceoten', data=df3).fit()
m3_3.summary()
# Holding all other factors fixed, if CEO tenure increases by 1 year, lsalary will increase by 1.17% 
# Question 3(iv)
pearsonr(df3['lmktval'],df3['profits']) 
# The Pearson R coefficient between log(market value) and profits is 0.78, this implies strong correlation between
# the two variables and likely collinearity within the model. Higher profits are generally associated with higher
# market value so including both would be difficult to capture the individual effects without OLS estimators 
# being biased.

# Question 4

# Read ATTEND data
df4 = pd.read_csv('/Users/Kyle/Desktop/Python/Data/ATTEND.csv')
df4.head()

# Question 4(i)
df4['atndrte'].min()
# 6.25
df4['atndrte'].max()
# 100.0
df4['atndrte'].mean()
# 81.71

df4['priGPA'].min()
#0.8570
df4['priGPA'].max()
# 3.9300
df4['priGPA'].mean()
# 2.5868

df4['ACT'].min()
# 13
df4['ACT'].max()
# 32
df4['ACT'].mean()
# 22.5103

# Question 4(ii)
m4_1 = ols('atndrte ~ priGPA + ACT', data = df4).fit()
m4_1.summary()
# atndrte = 75.7004 + 17.2606priGPA - 1.7166ACT
# The intercept states that a student with a 0.0 GPA the previous term and a 0 ACT score will attend, on average,
# around 75% of their classes. I don't believe that it is useful in this case as any students who have these characteristics
# will likely be removed from school in a practical setting.

# Question 4(iii)
# The coefficient on priGPA makes sense as a one unit increase in GPA (1.0/4.0 scale) is responsible for a 17% increase in attendance
# rate, all else held equal. Students who get higher grades are far more likely to go to class more consistently.
# The coefficient on ACT was surprising, however, as its sign was negative when I expected it to be positive. Additionally,
# the magnitude implied for a 1 unit increase in the score (out of 36), attendance rate dropped 1.7%, all else held equal. 
# Students who perform higher on tests should generally be overall higher performing students.

# Question 4(iv)
p1 = pd.DataFrame({'priGPA': [3.65], 'ACT': [20]})
p1
m4_1.predict(p1)
# 104.37
# This result is not possible in the dataset given the maximum attendance rate is 100% (all 32 classes attended)
# Additionally, there are no students in the sample with those values of explanatory variables

# Question 4(v)
p2 = pd.DataFrame({'priGPA': [3.1, 2.1], 'ACT': [21, 26]})
p2
m4_1.predict(p2)
# Student A: 93.1606
# Student B: 67.3173
print(93.1606-67.3173)
# 25.8433
# Student A is predicted to attend ~25% more classes than Student B

# Question 7

# Read MEAP93 data
df7 = pd.read_csv('/Users/Kyle/Desktop/Python/Data/MEAP93.csv')
df7.head()

# Question 7(i)
m7_1 = ols('math10 ~ lexpend + lnchprg', data = df7).fit()
m7_1.summary()
# math10 = -20.3607 + 6.2297lexpend - 0.3046lnchprg, n = 408, r2 = 0.180
# The sign on the lexpend I expected to be positive, as higher spending within a school per student
# will likely lead to higher math scores due to better quality teaching and materials.
# The sign on lnchprg I also expected to be negative, as students who are on lunch programs are far more
# likely to be from lower-income families in districts with much lower access to resources.

# Question 7(ii)
# It does not make sense to set the explanatory variable lexpend to 0. Setting it to 0
# would be equivilant to setting expend = 1, which implies that a school is only spending $1 per student
# when the minimum value for expendature per student is $3332 in the dataset.
# Setting lnchprg to 0 makes more sense as it could be a very high income school district where students do
# not need to be on a school lunch program.
df7['expend'].min()
# Having a negative intercept is not really indicative of anything given the data, as it does not make sense
# to have -20% of students passing MEAP math if the explanatory variables are set to 0.

# Question 7(iii)
m7_2 = ols('math10 ~ lexpend', data = df7).fit()
m7_2.summary()
# math10 = -69.3411 + 11.1644lexpend
# The slope coefficient on lexpend has increased from 6.2297 to 11.1644, a 0.05% increase in MEAP math scores 
# per dollar spent on students

# Question 7(iv)
pearsonr(df7['math10'], df7['lexpend'])
# 0.1722
# Having math10 and lexpend being positively correlated makes sense to me given that access to better 
# resources will generally allow students to perform better.

# Question 7(v)
# Because the two variables are positively correlated, having solely lexpend in a regression will yield a 
# more pronounced spending effect ____________????????????????????????????????????
