# the instrumental variable must have a non-zero coefficient

# The estimated effect increases (becomes less negative) from -0.0906 in OLS to -0.0350 in IV2SLS

# After adding the additional variables, the coefficient is decreased to -0.0884 (more negative)
# compared to the original IV2SLS without these new variables

# This time, the IV2SLS made the negative effect greater than the OLS, but is also less precise

# In the OLS model, holding all other variables constant, if a woman has a TV, then we expect
# her number of children to decrease by -0.2531
# In the IV2SLS model, hold all other variables constant, if a woman has a TV, then we expect
# her number of children to decrease by -13.1044

# Time watching TV may compete with time spent procreating, also exposure to urban/western media
# may also change lifestyles of values of these women
